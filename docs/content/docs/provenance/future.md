Further clarifying and simplifying the provenance information is an obvious want for the future.

A few particularities exist because of the violation of channel uniqueness, so solving this problem in a more general way will help simplify provenance too.

Depending on further developments and needs of the frontend graph engine, we may extend provenance labels. The fact that the leaves can have any string as a label makes this structure very flexible and expandable.

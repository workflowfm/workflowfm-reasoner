The WorkflowFM Reasoner is implemented within the interactive theorem proving environment of [HOL Light](https://github.com/jrh13/hol-light).

It also depends on 3 additional libraries that need to be present in the HOL Light directory.

We have a repository set up for a quick configuration, or you can install everything manually.
